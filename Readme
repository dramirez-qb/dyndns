# DynDNS

Web-App for PowerDNS with MySQL Backend.

You should have an existing PowerDNS MySQL-Database to use this app. Maybe additional table fields are required for your database. Take a look into the source to see what is needed.

## Installation

git clone
cd into/directory
bundle

## Hosting

We use Phusion Passenger, but you can use thin, unicorn or any other rack server as well.
